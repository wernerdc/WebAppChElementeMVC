# WebApp mit ASP.NET core MVC + Material Kit 3 HTML/CSS Framework

I try to implement different CSS/HTML layouts into the Basic ASP.NET core template from Visual Studio.

## The branches are:

1. Master -> Basic ASP.NET core Layout using some Bootstrap CSS by default
2. StyleSbAdmin -> a very basic CSS/HTML layout which also uses Bootstrap as its base
3. MaterialUI -> an advanced CSS/HTML layout which uses Bootstrap as basis and also CSS styles for Material 3 design

## Compile

After cloning the repo you have to update the database. To do it in Visual Studio you can execute this command in the packet manager console: 
`update-database`
